Accurate and efficient non-rigid registration is important to investigate neural mechanisms in multi-session two-photon (2p) imaging across a few days. The 2p imaging recordings from different sessions usually possess certain complex misalignment or huge data variance due to relocation errors during experimental operations or brain recovery. Most of the reported neural image registration tools were able to solve the registration problem in the same session with small deformation. However, the registration of neural images across multi-sessions remains a challenge. In this study, we report the development of a non-rigid registration method based on image triangulation and piecewise affine transformation (TPAT) technologies. The TPAT method supported both automatic and semi-automatic operation types, and both showed great performance in the benchmark test of non-rigid neural image registration. The proposed method constitutes a step forward in promoting and accelerating discoveries from multi-session 2p imaging researches.
